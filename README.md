# Telekom_SSI

Aufgaben: 
  1. A technical comparison of DIDComm and OIDC
  2. If OIDC already exists, then why OIDC for Verifiable Credentials?
  3. Different between traditional OIDC and OpenID4VC / VP. How does OpenID4VC / VP support the idea of SSI?
  4. Does OpenID4VC / VP supports selective attribute disclosure / ZKP?
  5. Working POC using walt.id code https://github.com/walt-id
