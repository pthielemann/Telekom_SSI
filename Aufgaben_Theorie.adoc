== 1. A technical comparison of DIDComm and OIDC
.What is DIDComm?
* messaging protocol that provides utility for DID based relationships 
** which are the foundation of SSI
* Exchange of DIDs to form a connection
** both parties have a self-certifying and mutually authenticated relationship
* *secure, interoperable & flexible* general messaging overlay for the entire internet

.Properties of DIDComm
* secure
* private
* interoperable
* transport-agnostic
* extensible

* not dependent on a specific operating system, programming language, vendor, network or hardware
* aims to become the common language of any secure, private, self-sovereign interaction on and off the internet
* makes use of any transport mechanisms _(HTTP(s), Websockets, IRC, Bluetooth, NFC, Signal, email, push notifications on a smartphone, etc.)_

.DIDComm protocols
core applications:
* connecting with others
* requesting and issuing credentials
* proving things using credentials
